# Pre-ProjectAnalysis
This Project focuses on anomaly detection techniques for Parkinson’s disease, the insight generated by the algorithm is useful for doctors to diagnose the patient efficiently. It can help the patient with symptoms to diagnose whether he/she is positive or negative of Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s Outlier analysis is very useful in real life as it is very difficult to identify specific symptoms as every individual goes through a different type of symptoms and by going through all undesired symptoms we can get a brief knowledge of the disease.
